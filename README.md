# C-learning-project
This is just a small text game made with C using the ncurses library.  The point of this isnt to make a good game in the least. Its more of a 
personal learning experiment. If you are experienced with C and care enough to give me suggestions then go ahead but this project probably isnt going anywhere. 



progress:

 

the screen is now split up into different windows one for the output one for the map one for the stats and one for the input.
i will eventually use the mouse for scrolling the output window and charecter movement.

map display done and commands are working a bit

enemies are now random and mapfiles now contain data on what enemies should appear in the area still lots of bugs that need to be fixed
