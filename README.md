# C-learning-project
This is just a small text game made with C using the ncurses library.  The point of this isnt to make a good game in the least. Its more of a 
personal learning experiment. If you are experienced with C and care enough to give me suggestions then go ahead but this project probably isnt going anywhere. 



progress:

Loading firearms is now possible but now im going to have to figure out how to handle swapping weapons and what to do with that ammo inside the gun.
Im also going to have to fix some of the glaring bugs in order to make things more presentable.
