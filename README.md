# C-learning-project
This is just a small text game made with C using the ncurses library.  The point of this isnt to make a good game in the least. Its more of a 
personal learning experiment. If you are experienced with C and care enough to give me suggestions then go ahead but this project probably isnt going anywhere. 



progress:

i have rewrote a lot of the code to make it more flexible in the last 
week. movement seems to be working and the inventory system is now 
functional. Next will be setting the values for all the items and 
migrating most of structures and stuff to header files to keep things 
more organized.
