# C-learning-project
This is just a small text game made with C using the ncurses library.  The point of this isnt to make a good game in the least. Its more of a 
personal learning experiment. If you are experienced with C and care enough to give me suggestions then go ahead but this project probably isnt going anywhere. 



progress:

OK for now when weapons are swapped the ammo is added back into your backpack later ill make it so the weapon is auto loaded every time you equip it or 
something.
im still  going to have to fix some of the glaring bugs in order to make things more presentable.
But  next im going to start fixing up the combat.

combat actually uses your shooting and fighting variables. ammo is now used in combat and a new variable has been added to items called melee wich determines if its a melee weapon or not.
