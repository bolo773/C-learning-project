# C-learning-project
This is just a small text game made with C using the ncurses library.  The point of this isnt to make a good game in the least. Its more of a 
personal learning experiment. If you are experienced with C and care enough to give me suggestions then go ahead but this project probably isnt going anywhere. 



progress:



combat actually uses your shooting and fighting variables. ammo is now used in combat and a new variable has been added to items called melee wich determines if its a melee weapon or not. 

the screen is now split up into different windows one for the output one for the map one for the stats and one for the input.
i will eventually use the mouse for scrolling the output window and charecter movement.

finished the code for the map displayer just need to put it into the master
